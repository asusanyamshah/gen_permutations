# Instructions

Make sure all the files are in the same directory. Using terminal, use the cd command to navigate to that folder that contains these files and run ```python gen_individual_permutations.py```

The file ```gen_individual_permutations``` will generate all the permutations for each particular contraceptive and store it in a csv with the name
```contraceptive_name_permutations.csv```

After the code is done running, you will see a new folder called ```individual_permutations```. Inside that folder, you will be able to see all 
the csv files.
